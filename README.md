# shapearoo-demo

Welcome to Shaparearoo! This repo is a mockup for a platform that hopes to bridge the gap between
architects and product designers with local manufacturers. With the rise home manufacturing with the use of 3d printers, 
which are getting more affordable, product manufacturing can soon be no longer tied to large scale, often overseas
manufacturing plants, that are only profitable when they produce on a scale. Shapearoo will allow designers
everywhere to sell their designs while a the closest 3d printer hub to the buyer will produce the item. 

Here are the key directories of this repo:

- pages and views: /app/views
- scripts: /src/js
- styles: /src/css
- routes: /app/routes
- controllers: /app/controllers
- database script: /app/config/shapearoo-demo-database.sql

Shapearoo is run wih PostgreSQL, Express, and Node, with EJS as the templating engine.
